                      <p> <span style="color: black;font-size: 14px;">My time in Erasmus:</span> <br>As an Erasmus student in Ostrava, Czech Republic, I faced numerous challenges during my stay. One of the biggest difficulties I faced was the collision of my course timetable. I had selected several subjects, but unfortunately, their schedules clashed, making it hard for me to attend all the classes. Initially, I tried to attend all the courses, but soon I realized it was an impossible feat.


                       
                        <br>Despite the scheduling challenges, I managed to take some exciting courses during my stay. One of the most interesting courses was Best Practices of the Communication Network. The course covered a wide range of topics such as network design, protocols, and security. The lecturer was knowledgeable and engaging, making the subject matter easy to comprehend.
                        
                        
                        <br>However, not all the courses were as stimulating. For instance, the Algorithm course was taught by a professor who had poor teaching skills and struggled to communicate in English. The course was challenging, and the lack of clear instruction made it even harder to understand.
                        
                        <br>Another course I took was Probability and Statistics. The class was taught by an experienced lecturer who made the subject matter engaging and relevant. I learned a lot about probability theory and statistical methods, which was valuable for my future studies.

                        <br>In the Theories of Graphs course, the initial lecturer was a teaching assistant who struggled to deliver compelling lectures. However, the university took the initiative to change the lecturer, and the new lecturer was exceptional, providing clear instruction and engaging content. I was thrilled with the outcome of the change.

                        <br>Besides my academic courses, I also enrolled in Czech language classes, which were essential for me to understand and communicate with locals. Additionally, I took a programming language course in Assembly, which was challenging but rewarding.


                        <br>In conclusion, my experience as an Erasmus student in Ostrava is not without its challenges, but I am glad we have to took the opportunity to study abroad. I already gained valuable knowledge and skills from my courses, and I learned a lot about Czech culture and language. Overall, my time in Ostrava is a valuable and enriching experience.
